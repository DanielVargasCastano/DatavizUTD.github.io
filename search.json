Bold letters make it clear which category is each column, and the bold number in the rank column shows the rank of each car make. All of the car brands are underlined, which does not add much to the design. The colors on the Satisfaction score clearly depict which car brand has higher consumer satisfaction with a stoplight color pallet. Then even more detail is added with the percentage of owners who would buy the same brand again. There is a problem when there are ties as it is unclear of why one brand would be preferred over the other. The rank should stay constant in those cases and skip the ranks for the next one. Otherwise, the rank column does not give much information.\nreturn"
